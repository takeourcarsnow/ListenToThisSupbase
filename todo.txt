fix small typewriter breaking to new line mid-word

when playing posts one by one from post play it should not say queue number

upload audio player fix big bottom margin
tags not working 
on phone right hand side of elements are cut off
sliding through tabs makes buggy cause i can see elements of tab im sliding off from rearranging, not a seamless experience even though it technically works but those glitches in transitions are distracting . it's because header disappears when sliding to new tab while still visible
